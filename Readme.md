## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Weather API Errors
```bash
# Check API keys in .env file
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
WEATHERAPI_KEY=your_key_here
```

#### Model Loading Issues
```bash
# Ensure saved_models directory exists
mkdir saved_models

# Train models if you have dataset
python train_model.py
```

### Virtual Try-On Limitations
Due to IDM-VTON API rate limits, virtual try-on functionality may be temporarily unavailable. This is expected behavior when API quotas are exceeded. 

**For Contributors & Forkers:**
- Fork the repository to use your own IDM-VTON API allocation
- The virtual try-on interface and selection system work perfectly
- Results depend on external API availability
- Consider implementing local IDM-VTON deployment for production use

#### spaCy Model Issues
```bash
# Re-install spaCy model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `debug=True` in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```
